# Digital Logic
In this class, I've learnt a lot about logical circuit and also how to draw a complex circuit by just using Universal gate such as NAND gate and NOR gate. This is said because before this I only used basic gate which required me to used a lot of gate. I also learnt how construct Karnaugh Map (K-Map) based on the truth table and so on. In this class, I also have done lab activity which required me to built a circuit.

On 2nd November 2023, me and my partner have done lab activity at PMO Lab. Before the lab activity, we are required to make the logic circuit by using Deeds. It was my first time to use Deeds to make logic circuit as during my matriculation I need to draw it manually. Besides, It it is also my first to make the circuit using breadboard. Not to mention that I also get learn a lot of things, for instance, I get to know the exact shape of different gate, get to now a lot of component on ETS which came with different functionality. It was a great experience for me as a first year student. The circuit may be hard to make it came out as what I predicted as it was my first time. But to be honest, it all thanks to my partner in helping me to understand the flow of the circuit better as it was my maiden experience in making the circuit.

On 12th December 2023, me and my partner have assigned with another lab activity by Dr. Zueriahati. This lab activity doesn't required us to go into the PMO Lab to make to make the circuit which it required me and my partner to figure it out the circuit ourselves by applying the topic that have been taught by Dr. Zueriahati. The topic is about we need to apply both theory regarding basic gate and Universal gate. Me and my partner do have problem in understanding the question as it was quite complicated to be understand due to the question that required us to used multiple logic gate. After some time, we are able to solve the question.

On 11th January 2024, me and my partner have done lab activity that required our understanding to synchronous of digital counter which we need to used flip flop concept. Before the day of the lab activity, we meet up to make do the circuit using Deeds where the circuit was a little bit complicated and confiusing due to the presence of the JK flip flop. On the day of the lab activity, we're taking quite some time to do the circuit as the making of the circuit on the breadboard ain't easy as doing it in Deeds with the presence of too many wire. After completed our circuit, the result for the digital didn't came out as we predicted therefore we need to change our ETS in making sure that our circuit is successful. Fortunately, our circuit was fully completed after getting the result as we predicted.
