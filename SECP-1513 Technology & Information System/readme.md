On 23th and 28th October 2023, I've attended a Career Development Talk present by alumni of UTM and staff of Pittsburg Plate Glass Company (PPG). The talk was inspiring me in how to prepared a good resume to apply for a job in the future. Besides, I also get to know what I will be experiencing throughout my intern working life in the next coming year. After the talk, we are required to make our own poster based on the talk.

On 17th November 2023, our class has went to industrial visit to HUAWEI and PETRONAS. Mr. Roman Kvaska and Mr. Ninderjit Singh has open my eyes in how things 'REALLY WORK' in working life in this industry. For example, this industry could be hard for some people therefore we need to manage our time by getting a "me-time" after a long day of work. At HUAWEI, I get to know a lot of new and advanced tech that I've never heard or seen before. I also get to know that HUAWEI sponsored Ideahub at UTMDigital where UTMDigital used it TM Room for video conference and etc.

<summary>Reflection:</summary>
On 22th November 2023, I've done this lab activity along with my groupmates. During activity. the lab technician show us step-by-step on how to assemble and reassemble the CPU. Not to mention that we also get to know the name of each part of the internal component and also the do's and don's on each component. The experience to open up the CPU is very fascinating as this is my maiden to open and look into the internal part of computer hardware. Plus, I get to know the function of every component of the internal component of CPU where this experience is very worth it for a computer science students and hope to get to experience more with more complex device.

On 13th December 2023, our class have visited UTMDigital for industrial visit. The visit was very interesting as the staff itself explaining everything to us as simple as they could. I also get to experience a 'REAL' working space for an employee when I visit the Open Office of UTMDigital. And again, I get to experience the Ideahub in TM Room which sponsored by HUAWEI where I already mention before during industrial visit to HUAWEI.
