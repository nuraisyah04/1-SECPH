# Discrete Structure
In this class, I've learnt a lot of of calculation theorem which required my logical thinking skills in solving the problem of the questions. Besides, I also have done a few assignment and quizzes prepared by my lecturer Dr. Noorfa, where the assignment need to be done in a group of three to four person per group. 

## Course Content
* Chapter 1 : Set Theory and Logic
* Chapter 2 : Relations and Functions
* Chapter 3 : Counting Methods and Probability
* Chapter 4 : Graph Theory
* Chapter 5 : Finite Automata

## Assignment
### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/nuraisyah04/1-SECPH/blob/main/SECI-1013%20Discrete%20Structure/Discrete%20structure%20-%20Assignment%201%20(Correction).pdf)
This are the first assignment assigned by Dr. Noorfa where we need to apply the topic that has been taught by her in which the topic is about set theory, elements of logic and proof techniques.<br>

### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/nuraisyah04/1-SECPH/blob/main/SECI-1013%20Discrete%20Structure/Assignment%202%20discrete%20structure_231129_222321.pdf)
Next assignment was about relation, function and recurrence relation. This time the assignment need to submitted as softcopy through UTM's e-Learning.

### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/nuraisyah04/1-SECPH/blob/main/SECI-1013%20Discrete%20Structure/Assigment%203%20(1).pdf)
This time the assignment was about pigeonhole theory, probability and graph theory.
