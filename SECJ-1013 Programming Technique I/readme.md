# Programming Technique 1
In this class, I've learnt a new pprogramming language which is C++. The programming language was rather shorter than Java that I used to learnt during matriculation. Besides, in this also I had learnt a new topic which does not cover during matriculation. For instance, pointers and structured data. The topic was new to new and I'm still trying to understand the topic.

## Assignment
### Assignment 1
View my [first assignment](https://github.com/nuraisyah04/1-SECPH/blob/main/SECJ-1013%20Programming%20Technique%20I/Programming%20Technique%201%20-%20Assignment%201%20%20(1)%20(1).pdf) assigned by Dr. Eiliyah which me and my partner need to create a flowchart for the question given. The chart may be a bit confusing as we need to used other function for the calculation. The flowchart also used looping to ensure the track of calculation is recorded.<br>

### Assignment 2
Based on the first assignment that have been done, we are required to write a C++ code based on the flowchart that has been created. Same with the first assignment we need to defined a separate function for the calculation. I find it interesting as my code become more shorter as I just need to invoke the function that I already defined.<br>
